"Far From Home" Project

A VR project I contributed to as part of the Visual Narrative Innitiative at NCSU. Using context provided by our team historian, I helped develop a VR walking tour of World-War-I-Era environments. Our designers worked on creating a farmhouse environment and a trench environment, and our development team optimized the assets for VR interactions. I contributed by setting up our Unity workstations and inmplementing the Oculus integration package, as well as programming basic interactions and locomotion mechanics. I also worked to implement spatial sound, lighting, and post-processing effects available through the Unity engine.

\*When running the demo, pressing the "A" button on the right-hand controller alternates between scenes. Users can cast a waypoint out from either hand by pressing forward on the analog stick and releasing to "teleport" to the position of the waymarker (similar to *Robo Recall*)
